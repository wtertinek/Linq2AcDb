### Contributing

Please:

- open an [issue](https://github.com/wtertinek/Linq2Acad/issues) if you've found a bug,
- a [discussion](https://github.com/wtertinek/Linq2Acad/discussions/new) for a feature request, and then, 
- a pull request if you want to help extending the library.

For those with graphic design abilities: it would be nice to have a Linq2Acad logo.
